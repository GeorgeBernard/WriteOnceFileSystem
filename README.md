TODO:

1. ECC integration
2. Cleanup shared code
3. Test (find max point of failure)
4. Consider header file (should elements be different sizes) 
5. General code cleanup 
6. Benchmarking 
7. Stream implementation on write in Master       **DONE**
8. Alignment
9. Hard link and soft link investigation 
10. Safe traversal - to prevent segfaults 

Know limitations:

* Size
* ECC 
* Hard-soft
